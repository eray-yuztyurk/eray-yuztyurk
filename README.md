# ERAY YUZTYURK, BSc.
Data Engineer | Machine Learning & AI Developer

Hi — I'm Eray. I build data-first solutions that turn messy information into reliable products: ETL and data pipelines, ML models and APIs, and interactive dashboards. I combine practical engineering with applied machine learning to deliver tools that teams can use in production and decision-making.

How to review my work (quick guide for recruiters / reviewers)
1. Look at the pinned repos on my profile — they contain a short demo and the most polished examples.  
2. Open the README of the repo(s) that interest you: I include a short project summary, how-to-run, and results/metrics when applicable.  
3. Try the live demo links (if present) or run the repo locally using the "How to run" instructions.  
4. If you want more, ask for the project-specific notebook or architecture notes — I can share a short technical write-up.

Typical repo README checklist I follow (so you know what to expect)
- One-line summary
- Short problem statement
- Tech stack and requirements
- Quick setup (local + Docker if available)
- Example run & expected output / demo link
- Results (metrics) and short discussion
- License and contribution notes

Motivation / cover note (English, from my perspective)
I am writing to express my interest in roles where I can apply my skills in data engineering and AI development. I have hands-on experience in data science, machine learning and automation, and I enjoy building practical solutions that enable data-driven decisions. My background with Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and Keras — combined with cloud knowledge and automation experience — allows me to develop, train and deploy models that add measurable value. I have automated data workflows, integrated advanced analytics into business processes, and built tools for extraction, preprocessing and transformation. I also develop dashboards and evaluation frameworks so stakeholders can understand and act on model outputs. I am motivated to bring this experience into an AI-focused role and contribute to building reliable, maintainable systems.

Resume highlights (short)
- Technical certifications: IBM Data Science, IBM Machine Learning, AWS Cloud Practitioner
- Strong foundation in statistics, linear algebra and applied ML (Duke / Bootcamp)
- Multiple end-to-end projects: data pipelines → model → API → dashboard
- Languages: English (fluent), German (fluent), Turkish (native), Italian (basic)

Languages
- English — fluent
- German — fluent
- Turkish — native
- Italian — basic

Repository hygiene / next improvements I'm working on
- Add clear pinned projects and one-line taglines for each.
- Add LICENSE to primary repos (MIT/Apache-2.0).
- Add small CI (lint/tests) to core repos.
- Deploy 2–3 projects with live demos and add GIF screenshots to READMEs.
- Add short architecture notes to the two most important projects.

Suggested repos to pin (my recommendation)
- cocktailme-app — interactive recommendation app (Flask)
- power-bi-bank-performance-report-dashboard — BI dashboard
- python-flask-transaction-tracker-project — API + UI example
- collaborative-filtering-movie-recommender — data science / recommender example

How you can use this README
- Create a new public repository with the exact name of your GitHub username (eray-yuztyurk) and add this README.md as the repository README — GitHub will show it on your profile.
- Replace placeholders (email, LinkedIn, portfolio) and check links to the repos above.
- Add an `assets/` folder with a profile cover or screenshots to make the page visually stronger.

What I prepared for you now and what I can do next
- I prepared a full, ready-to-use English profile README that reads like you wrote it (first-person, concise, practical).  
- Next I can:
  - Generate the actual repo README files for the 4 suggested pinned projects (one each), including a "how to run" and a short demo GIF placeholder.
  - Produce a short, English cover letter tailored to a specific job posting (if you share the job description).
  - Create CI / simple Dockerfile templates for 1 repo you pick.

Would you like me to:
- (A) Prepare the 4 project README drafts next, or
- (B) Produce a tailored cover letter for a job posting, or
- (C) Create the profile repo contents and a visual assets pack (you supply images)?

Tell me which option and I’ll start immediately.
